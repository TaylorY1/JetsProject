# Jets Project

### Description

This program allows you to interact with an Airfield that holds Airframes within it. As I am a prior crew chief (airframe mechanic), the Jet class has been named "Airframes" to make more sense to me. Upon start of the application, you will be presented with a fully functioning menu that will accept input from 1 to 9:

1 List fleet
2 Fly all jets
3 View fastest jet
4 View jet with longest range
5 Load all Cargo Jets
6 Dogfight!
7 Add a jet to Fleet
8 Remove a jet from Fleet
9 Quit

When you select "1," you will be presented with a list of all the Airframes you have on the Airfield with their type, name, max speed, max mile range and their individual prices. Once you select a menu item, you will be presented with the menu repeatedly until you select "9" which exits the program and displays "Goodbye!" Upon selection of the number 2 number, you will be shown each individual plane's fly method which includes different sayings depending on the planes capability. If you select 3 to view the fastest jet, you will be presented with the jet with the fastest mile per hour speed. This is very similar for the 4 selection, except you will see the Airframe with the longest fuel range. Selection number 5 will tell the Airfield to load up all the cargo jets which will load the planes and then have them take off! This is similar to selection number 6. Selection number 6 will tell the Airfield to send out all the fighter jets to go fight in the air which is called dogfighting. If you select number 7, you will be asked for a name, speed in MPH, range in miles and the price of the jet to be added to the Airfield. That will now be indexed and if it is now the fasted jet or the jet with the longest range, it will now populate when asked in the future and can be seen on the Airfield when you press 1 after inserting your jet. The same can be said for selection number 8. If you select number 8, you will be presented with another menu of a list of Airframes to remove from the flee for maintenance repairs. When you remove a jet and select 1 again, you will be shown a list of Airframes on the Airfield, minus the Airframe that you selected from the submenu. You will be shown the menu repeatedly until you select the option titled 9, which will allow you to exit the application.  

### Technologies Used

There were several Technologies used during the building of this application. Eclipse was the IDE used to develop this program and it was uploaded to github for grading. The other Technologies used within Java were the Scanner, multiple loops, for loops, for each loops, proper instanciation of methods and fields, menus, switch statements, a vast use of methods, Sysouts, extensions, implementation of seperate interfaces, overriding methods, setters and getters, toStrings and all of the required constructors.

### Lessons Learned

The biggest lesson I learned during this assignment was that I really need to write out my plan before creating code. For this assignment and its huge amount of requirements, I created a "shell" of the program/application and inside each individual element of the application I would write out what exactly needed to happen in that place. With that all written out, it was so much easier to figure out what I needed to do in each method and each class and for each selection. This is something I realized I will do for every Java project in the future as it was so incredibly helpful in the end. This helped me organize my thoughts and decide the proper action.

### What was fun?

The thing I found most fun from writing this program was that I feel like I finally was able to put everything together from theory, to idea, to actually writing the code that was necessary. I required a lot less help from the TA's this week and I truly feel like everything has finally been cemented in my brain and it truly showed me how much I have learned in these 3 weeks. I realize I still need SO much more practice with writing code but this homework showed me how well I am picking up the concepts and ideas of the program.
